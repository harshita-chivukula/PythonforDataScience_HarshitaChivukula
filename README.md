# Python for Data Science Class 1

This Assignment3 branch contains the notes and homework for Class three, in which we introduce and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python through a hands-on course registration system. The exercises explore concepts like classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. In the exercises, we are trying to create a restration system for student and courses. 

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 1:** Course Class, where each course has a name, a description and a list of enrolled students. 
2. **Exercise 2:** Student Class, where each student has a name, ID number, address and a list of enrolled courses
3. **Exercise 3:** Registration System, which manages courses and students,
4. **Exercise 4:** GPA Calculation that builds on Registration system by adding grades to each student's course and creating method that yields the GPA given a student name or ID.

## Requirements

To run these exercises, you need Python 3.10 installed. You can clone the repository and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

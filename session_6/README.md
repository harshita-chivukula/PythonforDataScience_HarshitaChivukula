# Python for Data Science Class: Pandas and Data Exploration

This branch contains the notes and exercises for the class focused on using **Pandas** for data loading, exploration, and preprocessing. The session covers essential techniques for working with datasets, including cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

1. **Pandas** - An introduction to Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis, especially useful for handling tabular data.

2. **Loading and Exploring Datasets** - Techniques to load datasets from various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and perform initial explorations, such as:
   - Viewing the structure of data
   - Summarizing data statistics
   - Identifying missing values

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with Pandas** - Methods for preparing data, including:
   - Handling missing values and duplicates
   - Transforming data types
   - Filtering and selecting relevant data
   - Applying transformations to clean data and prepare it for analysis

## Exercises

### Pandas I
Introductory exercises with Pandas:
1. Count Missing Values in Each Column.
2. Fill Missing `country` Values with "Unknown".
3. Filter for TV Shows Only.
4. Count the Number of Entries per Rating.
5. Add a Column Showing Content Age (years since release).

### Pandas II
Practice with the *Titanic* dataset:
1. Count the Missing Values in Each Column.
2. Fill Missing `Age` Values with the Mean Age.
3. Fill Missing `Embarked` Values with the Mode (Most Common Value).
4. Filter and Display Passengers Who Paid a Fare Above the Average Fare.
5. Add a New Column Indicating Family Size (`FamilySize` = `SibSp` + `Parch`).

### Pandas III - Home Exercises

**Netflix Dataset:**
1. Check for any missing rating.
2. Count the number of films in 2021 from your country.
3. Find the number of movies in 2020 with complete information.
4. Determine the year with the most titles.
5. Calculate the average number of releases per year from 2010 onward.

**Titanic Dataset:**
1. Calculate the Gender-Based Survival Percentage.
2. Calculate the Survival Percentage Grouped by Gender and Class.

## Requirements

To run these exercises, you need Python 3.10 and the Pandas library installed. You can clone the repository and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

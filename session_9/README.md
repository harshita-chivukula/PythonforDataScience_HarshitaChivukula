# Python for Data Science Class 9

This branch contains the notes and exercises for the class focused on **image manipulation** and the application of basic image processing algorithms. The session introduces tools like **PIL**, **OpenCV**, **Scikit-image**, and **Kornia** for handling and analyzing image data.

## Outline

1. **Image Manipulation (PIL, OpenCV)**  
   - Using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and OpenCV for basic image handling tasks, such as loading, resizing, cropping, and rotating images.

2. **Basic Use of Algorithms (Scikit-image, Kornia)**  
   - Applying basic image processing algorithms for tasks like edge detection, segmentation, and feature extraction using Scikit-image and Kornia.

## Exercises

1. Load an image of coins using **PIL** or **OpenCV**.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Use basic thresholding to segment the coins from the background.
4. Count the number of coins in the image using **Scikit-image** or **Kornia**.
5. Highlight the segmented coins by drawing bounding boxes or contours.

## Requirements

To run these exercises, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.10** or later
- Libraries: PIL, OpenCV, Scikit-image, Kornia
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any IDE supporting Python notebooks

# Python for Data Science Class 5

This branch contains the notes and homework for Class 5, focusing on using essential Python libraries for data processing, file management, and scientific computing. In this session, we use libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Math, os, glob, and shutil to manage and analyze annotation files based on a structured naming convention. Some more details on the libraries are:
  1.	Numpy - For numerical operations and array manipulation.
  2.	Scipy - For advanced scientific computing tasks.
  3.	Math, os, glob, and shutil - Utilities for mathematical calculations, file system operations, and file management.

## Exercises: Reusing the same annotations we worked with in the previous session

1. **Exercise 1:** Determine how many annotations there are per month and year, and identify which month has the most annotation files.
2. **Exercise 2:** Create a dictionary where each key is a month, and the corresponding value is a list containing all the annotation names whose date corresponds to that month. Then save in, JSON, Pickle, dictionary for each annotation. 
3. **Exercise 3:** Print all annotations from the oldest to the newest for the second half of 2024.

## Requirements

To run these exercises, you need Python 3.10 installed. You can clone the repository and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

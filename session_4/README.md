# Python for Data Science Class 4

This branch contains the notes and homework for Class 4, focusing on using essential Python libraries for data processing, file management, and scientific computing. In this session, we use libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Math, os, glob, and shutil to manage and analyze annotation files based on a structured naming convention. Some more details on the libraries: 
  1.	Numpy - For numerical operations and array manipulation.
	2.	Scipy - For advanced scientific computing tasks.
	3.	Math, os, glob, and shutil - Utilities for mathematical calculations, file system operations, and file management.

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 1:** Count the total number of files in the annotations folder.
2. **Exercise 2:** Identify how many files follow the specified naming convention.
3. **Exercise 3:** Count annotations per month and year, and find the month with the most annotations.
4. **Exercise 4:** Create a new annotations folder, organizing files by month.
5. **Exercise 5:** Print all annotations in order from the most recent to the oldest.
3. **Exercise 6:** Analyze satellite data.
4. **Exercise 7:** Count the number of unique regions.

## Requirements

To run these exercises, you need Python 3.10 installed. You can clone the repository and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

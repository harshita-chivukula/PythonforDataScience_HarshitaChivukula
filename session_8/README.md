# Python for Data Science Class 8

This branch contains the notes and exercises for the class focused on **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. These libraries are essential tools for data visualization, offering capabilities for creating informative and visually appealing plots. This session introduces various plotting techniques, customizations, and the integration of these libraries with **Pandas**.

## Outline

1. Introduction to the two primary plotting libraries in Python.
2. Techniques to create and customize plots for better data communication.

## Plotting

### **Matplotlib and Seaborn**

**Matplotlib** is the most widely used plotting library in the Python community. It offers robust functionality and can be used directly or through **Pandas** for basic visualizations.

**Seaborn**, built on top of **Matplotlib**, simplifies complex visualizations and enhances plots with better styles and color palettes. It is tightly integrated with **Pandas**, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis.

### Exercises

#### **Matplotlib Exercises**

- Find out the number of students in the top 5 universities for Executive Education (2024), based on the "Executive Education 2024" report published by Financial Times.  
  - Create a plot that includes a **title**, **x-label**, **y-label**, and **legend**.
  - Use the university's colors for each bar in the chart.
  - If exact data is unavailable, estimate close values.

#### **Seaborn Home Exercises**

1. Create a *lineplot* showing how **Study Time** varies by **Student Name**. Identify the student with the highest study time.
2. Plot a histogram (*histplot*) of **Grade** and determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.
3. Create an ECDF plot (*ecdfplot*) for **Grade**. Calculate the percentage of students scoring less than 85.
4. Create a *stripplot* showing **Grade** distribution for each **Course**. Determine which course has the most spread in grades.
5. Create a *swarmplot* to show the relationship between Gender and **Study Time**. Identify which gender has a higher average study time.
6. Plot a *pointplot* to show the average **Grade** for each Course. Identify the course with the highest average grade.

## Requirements

To run these exercises, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.10** or later
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any IDE supporting Python notebooks

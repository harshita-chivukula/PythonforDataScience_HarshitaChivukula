     - **Environment tasks**: Create and activate environments, install packages.
     - **Git tasks**: Practice Git commands and GitHub workflows.
     - **Python challenges**: Write functions like FizzBuzz, filter integers from lists, build a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit converter, and create a to-do list.

### 3. **Class 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (09/10/24) - *Exercises DONE*
   - **Objective**: Learn OOP principles by building a course registration system.
   - **Topics**: Classes, methods, encapsulation, inheritance.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **Course & Student classes**: Define attributes and methods for managing courses and students.
     - **Registration system**: Implement a system to handle course enrollments and withdrawals.
     - **GPA calculator**: Extend the registration system with grading and GPA calculation.

### 4. **Class 4: Basic Libraries I** (16/10/24) - *Exercises DONE*
   - **Objective**: Use key libraries for data processing and file management.
   - **Topics**: Numpy, Scipy, Math, `os`, `glob`, and `shutil`.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **File management**: Count files in directories, check naming conventions.
     - **Data analysis**: Organize files by date, count annotations by month/year, identify the most active months.
     - **Advanced tasks**: Sort annotations from newest to oldest and count unique regions in satellite data.

### 5. **Class 5: Basic Libraries II** (21/10/24) - *Exercises DONE*
   - **Objective**: Extend data management skills with additional libraries and practice with large datasets.
   - **Topics**: Numpy, Scipy, Math, `os`, `glob`, `shutil`.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **Data organization**: Analyze annotations per month, save data in multiple formats (JSON, Pickle).
     - **Sorting and filtering**: Sort annotations chronologically for specified periods and count occurrences by region.

### 6. **Class 6: Pandas – Data Loading, Cleaning, and Exploration** (06/11/24) - *Exercises DONE*
   - **Objective**: Introduce data manipulation with Pandas, including data cleaning and transformation.
   - **Topics**: Loading datasets, handling missing data, filtering, and preprocessing.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **Pandas I**: Basic data cleaning exercises, such as counting and filling missing values, filtering for specific content types, and creating derived columns.
     - **Pandas II (Titanic)**: Count and fill missing values, calculate average fares, and create a `FamilySize` column by summing `SibSp` and `Parch`.
     - **Pandas III (Netflix & Titanic)**:
       - **Netflix**: Identify missing ratings, count films by country, and find the year with the most releases.
       - **Titanic**: Calculate survival percentages by gender and class.

### 7. **Class 7: *PENDING*
### 8. **Class 8: *PENDING*
### 9. **Class 9: *PENDING*
